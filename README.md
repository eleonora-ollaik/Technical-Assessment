# Installation instructions:

    - clone this repository 

    After opening the folder run in terminal:
    - npm install
    - npm i -D json-server concurrently
    - npm i react-datepicker

    To run the project:

    - npm run dev (activates mock backend server and gets data from db.json)

# Technologies used:

    - JavaScript
    - React
    - CSS
    - Functional code is tested with Jest (./src/business_logic; to run - npm test business_logic.test.js)
    Dependancies: Json-Server (to mock back-end that will be easily replaced later), React Date Picker,

# Accomplishments:
 - Responsive page
 - Functional code that generates data works and is tested
 - Code allows to add new features easily
 - Contains a mock database that can be replaced by real one
 - Algorithms can be swapped for real ones any time without hurting the code
 - Time picker is defaulted to 10 days prior to the chosed date and prices are generated accordingly: this data can later be used for generating a graph with one of the libraries
